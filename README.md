Meow! I'm Shiranyari, but you can call me Shira! 🐈

Currently learning GDScript to advance my own solo game dev journey.

Most of my Godot project repos are private as they contain many custom made assets I am not comfortable to open source yet (ie art assets).

I may start open sourcing the code once I get better :3
